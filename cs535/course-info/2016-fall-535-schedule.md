### 2016-08-22 Week 1

**READING** ==> Sections 1 through 5 in [SANDIA-98: A Common Language for Computer Security Incidents](http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/1998/988667.pdf)

- [Homework 1](/535/hw1/) discussion
- [Homework 2 assigned](/535/hw2/)
- [Homework 3 assigned](/535/hw3/)

#### Topics

* What we mean by cyber security
* Taxonomy of Attacks (vulnerabilites, attacks, persistent threats)
* A framework for cybersecurity analysis

#### Attributes of Secure Systems

- Confidentiality ==> data privacy ensured (not public information)
- Authentication ==> authenticity of ownership ensured
- Integrity - information is immutable to those not authorized to change it
- Non-repudiation ==> neither sender nor receiver can deny that they performed a transaction
- Access control ==> access to information is controlled and limited to authorized parties
- Availability ==> protected and secure assets and information should remain available as needed (by authorized parties of course!)

```attack surface``` (how many components and to what degree can an attacker touch a system?) 

Examples: open sockets, open pipes, open rpc, number of services, web server scripts, accounts with elevated creds, percentage of file system with weak access controls

#### Major Threads in Vulnerability and Incidents

- Is it in the ```Design```, ```Implementation```, or ```Configuration``` of systems ... or is it all three?

#### Other ways of assessing vulnerability

- Social Engineering ==> the human problem in cyber attacks. Nigerian 419 scams, spam, phishing, pharming, spear-phishing, mules
- Authentication/Authorization
- Access permissions (file systems, etc..)
- Audits
- User Interface weaknesses

#### A Common Language for Computer Security Incidents

* class discussion
