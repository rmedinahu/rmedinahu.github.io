### Simple Sequence Analysis

### Description
This assignment requires that you create a python program (script) with two functions as indicated below.

### 1. Write, test, and debug a python function that accepts two parameters:

(1) a tuple containing a list (e.g., ```('a', 'b', 'f', ... 'q')```) and 

(2) a tuple containing a short sub sequence ```(e.g., ('a', 'd', 'e')```. 

The function should attempt to locate the sub sequence within the list and report the *frequency* of the sub sequence, the *indices* of each occurrence, and the ratio of the frequency to the total size of the list.

Example: Given a tuple such as,

>	seq = ('a', 'z', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'u', 'f', 'g', 'z')

and a sub sequence,

>	target = ('f', 'g')

the program would report

```2``` occurrences at ```2``` and at ```6``` with a frequency ratio of ```.22```


### 2. Write, test, and debug a python function that performs the same as above but utilizes strings instead of tuples:

Example: Given a string such as,

>	seq = 'azfghufgz'

and a sub sequence,

>	target = 'fg'

the program would report

```2``` occurrences at ```2``` and at ```6``` with a frequency ratio of ```.22```
