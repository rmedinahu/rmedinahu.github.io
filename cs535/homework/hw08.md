### Simple Symetric Block Cipher With Cipher Block Chain

**Related python packages**: 

```random```

### Description

Write a python program that implements a simple 8 bit block cipher using an 8 bit key (we will use a bit size that is convenient for ascii character manipulations). Implement the cipher as a function (```encipher(cleartext)```). Your program should also implement the decryption function (```decipher(ciphertext)```). The key used for encryption should be an 8 bit in length. Key should be applied to each block in the cleartext (and ciphertext for decryption of course) as follows:

*ciphertext[i] = key ^ cleartext[i]*

You will need to handle clear and cipher text at the bit level. This isn't necessary since we are using an 8-bit block but it's worth getting experience working with bit strings. As you know, 128 bit blocks are the usual for *AES*.

Bit manipulation requirements:

- blocks should be concatenated. That is, if there are 4 blocks in your cleartext, then the cipher text should contain these four blocks as one bit string.
- you should be able read off *k-bit* blocks from a large bit string. This necessary for processing the input cleartext as well reading in the ciphertext and reproducing the cleartext.


#### Cipher Block Chain 

[see pages 678-682 here (esp. p.682 description of CBC)]({{ site.baseurl }}assets/cs535/computer-networking-6ed-kurose-etal-chapter-8.pdf)

Use an 8 bit value for the **Initialization Vector**.
