### Simple Shell Interpreter

**Related python packages**: 
	
[subprocess](https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html) or [envoy (optional)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/envoy)

### Description
Write a simple command line interpreter in python. The program should:
	
- Display a *prompt* (e.g., ```ram$ ``` ) that accepts shell *commands* (e.g., ```ls```, ```pwd```, etc.)
- Program should exit if the user simply presses ```Enter``` key without a command otherwise it prints the command output then redisplays the prompt to accept the next command.
- Program should include two functions:

{% highlight python %}

#  accepts a shell command as a string, executes command using ```subprocess``` (or envoy if you want)
#  returns the output of the command
def run_command(commandstr):
	.... 

#  accepts a string indicating the label to use for the prompt.
#  the prompt should run indefinitely until the exit condition is met.
#  returns nothing but should invoke ```run_command``` appropriately
def shell_prompt(prompt_label):
    ....

{% endhighlight python %}

- Things to try:
	* navigate/view different folders in the filesystem
	* attempt to use ```cat``` to view a file (once you have *learned* its path and name!)
