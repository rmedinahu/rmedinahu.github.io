### Client/Server Network Application -- Peeking At Remote Files


#### Description
Write a client/server python application. The server should accept requests from client processes asking for the contents of a file specified by a file name in the request. For example:

> 1. client application sends request for file contents by sending the server a file name.
> 2. server attempts to open the file indicated by the file name
> 3. if file opening is successful, server reads the contents into a variable and sends it BACK to client
> 4. client receives the server's response and prints the result to the screen.
