### Roll Your Own Midterm Project

### Description

Your midterm project (instead of exam) will ask you to tap in to your creative selves and come up with an idea for an application that you will implement in python. I really expect this to be a chance for you to have fun with python while programming in an application domain that is of interest to you. My requirements are that this application evidence some degree of competence in (a) **your programming skills** and (b) **your knowledge of python up to now**. Your idea does not have to relate to cybersecurity. There two *kinds* of application you can build:

##### Application Types:

* An application that requires user interaction. For example, a user opens your app, does something, and gets a result. You could think of this as a *utility*.

* An application that demonstrates the utility of existing python library and/or a third party python library. For example, the use of documentation generators.


##### Here are the detailed requirements:

* application must utilize functions. The design of your application should show that you know how to decompose a problem into discrete procedures and use them in a logical way.

* application must utilize one or more python libraries or third party python libraries. See below for ideas.

* application must include a *requirements* file containing *pinned* libraries and their version. This also implies that you utilize virtual environments but this is not necessarily required during development. (It's in your best interest to get familiar with this!).

* your application must be available on GitHub. (If you're not familiar with this, we'll cover it in class).

* you will provide a demonstration of your application to the class on Thursday of midterm week.

* your application should contain a readme file that describes:
	1. the purpose of your application
	2. the libraries used in your application
	3. in what context your application would be most useful

##### Some interesting libraries to look into :

* Sphinx, Pycrypto, pyqtgraph, Pywebview, psutil (this one would be great to use with pygtgraph!), arrow, sched    

Here are more. Start with the first one. It has clear explanations and demo code!
