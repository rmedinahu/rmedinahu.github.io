### Simple Bit Print Function

### Description
Write a program that contains a function, ```pbin(data, bitlen)```,  that accepts positive integer data, and an integer bit length. The function should print the bit string representation of the data at the given bit length to the screen. Your function should work for bit lengths of 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128. Write your program so that the user can enter data and bit lengths interactively, each time calling your  ```pbin()``` function. If the user enters -1, then the program should stop.

#### Example Execution

$ python printbits.py 
Enter a positive integer (ENTER -1 to quit):```2410```
Enter bit length to display:```16```

	BITS==>  ```0000100101101010```


Enter a positive integer (ENTER -1 to quit):```2410```
Enter bit length to display:```4```

	BITS==>  ```1010```


Enter a positive integer (ENTER -1 to quit):


#### How to extract (or "read off" a nth bitlen block from a 16 bit block. 
{% highlight python %}

blk = 0b1010111111111111
bitlen = 8
mask = 2**bitlen-1  # a sequence of 1 bits

n = 0
sublk = (blk >> (n*bitlen)) & mask
bin(sublk)

# reading off the next bitlen block ... this should be in a loop right?
n = 1
sublk = (blk >> (n*bitlen)) & mask
bin(sublk)

{% endhighlight %}
