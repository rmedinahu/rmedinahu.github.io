## About This Course
The primary goal of this course is to introduce students to security aware application development primarily using the Python programming language with some exposure to security in web or networked based applications. Students will get hands on experience designing, writing, and evaluating applications that are security aware and will be able to evaluate security vulnerabilites in software design.

## Major Topics
* writing and testing security-aware applications
* analysis of malicious programs
* vulnerability analysis
* network security
* authentication frameworks
* data encryption
* security attacks

## Intended Outcomes
* understand and identify security vulnerabilities in contemporary software applications
* understand and demonstrate knowledge of security techniques used in software development
* be able to apply strategies and techniques for developing security aware applications
* understand encryption techniques and their role in security standards
* demonstrate high proficiency in the use of the Python programming language

## Course Requirements
0. **Regular (daily/weekly) access to NMHU Desire2Learn for this course is expected**
1. **Attendance/Participation is expected in both lecture and lab**. For grading purposes, attendance is computed as, total meetings - number of absences / total meetings
2. **Programming Assignments** - a minimum of one program is assigned (and due) per week.
3. **Quizzes** - short online quizzes will be given weekly or every two weeks. This includes two programming competency exams.
4. **Midterm and Final Exams** (comprehensive)

## Grading
* 10%	Attendance
* 20%	Quizzes/Competency Exams
* 35%	Programming Assignments (grading criteria indicated at the end of this syllabus)
* 35%	Midterm/Final

## Homework Policy
It is expected that deadlines for programming assignments will be honored. Late assignments will always be accepted and assessed. However, point deduction for late assignments will be calculated as follows:

* less than two days late ==> 10% reduction
* less than seven days late ==> 30% reduction
* more than a week late ==> assignment will be assessed but no credit will be given :(

All programming assignments should be submitted to the appropriate **dropbox** in the Desire2Learn website for this course or to your github repository (as directed by instructor).

Assigned homework/programming assignments are to be strictly the work of each individual student unless a group assignment is specified.

## Grading Criteria for Programming Assignments
* Each assigned program is worth 100 points. The criteria is as follows:

	* 30 points = Contains no syntax errors (it **COMPILES**) 
	* 20 points = **EXECUTES** without runtime errors 
	* 40 points = Program is **CORRECT** (performs as specified by instructions)
	* 5  points = Source code format follows acceptable style guidelines (indentation, whitespace, etc.) 
	* 5  points = **SUBMITTED ON TIME**

## How To Turn In Your Programming Assignments

All programming submissions should include the following on the first two lines of your source file *as comments*:

>		<LAST NAME, FIRST NAME> <DATE>
>		<HOMEWORK #>

Your source files should be named to include your last name first initial followed by hw assignment number as demonstrated below. **DO NOT USE SPACES in file names please!**

#### Example file name:

>		medinar-hw1.py

#### Example python source file:

    # Medina, Richard 1-19-2016
    # Homework 999

    def printmessage():
	    print('Hello. This is a sample program.')

    printmessage()
    
## A Note About CS350 Lab
Lab is intended to give you the opportunity to work out concepts and skills related to the weekly topics addressed in lecture. I take the approach that the lab is open to collaboration among students (help each other, ask each other). The Instructor and/or the Teaching Assistant are there to provide additional help and feedback during each lab session.
