### A Sample Software Project Setup

> [Homework 2 assigned](/451/hw2)

### Description
You are going create a sample software project to gain experience with deploying an application that meets [Prime Directive 3](/451/schedule/#prime-directives-for-open-source-software-development) at a minimum and not so much prime directives 1 and 2 (but it wouldn't hurt).

**Key Skill**: Setting up a workable software project (project layout, dependencies, requirements, etc.)

1. create a virtual environment, activate it then locate and find a python module to install in it.
	- ```pip install ...```
2. create a project and initialize its contents with git.
	- a project root folder that contains the following:
	- a requirements file containing your requirements listing
	- a source code directory containing your source code
	- documentation directory containing a readme.

3. Place code containing a simple demonstration of your python package in a source code file in your source code directory.

4. Generate and properly save your requirements file

5. Compose your readme.

4. Test, then push your repository to GitHub.
