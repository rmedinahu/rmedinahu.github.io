## About This Course
A study of the concepts and techniques of software engineering. Emphasis will be on object-oriented design principles, the integration of systems analysis methodologies into software engineering and topics such as formal specifications and proof of program correctness.

## Course Requirements
0. **Regular (daily/weekly) access to NMHU Desire2Learn for this course is expected**
1. **Attendance/Participation is expected**. For grading purposes, attendance is computed as, total meetings - number of absences / total meetings
2. **Homework Assignments** - a minimum of one homework is assigned (and due) per week.
3. **Midterm and Final Exams** (comprehensive)

## Grading
* 10%	Attendance
* 45%	Homework Assignments
* 45%	Midterm/Final

## Homework Policy
It is expected that deadlines for homework assignments will be honored. Late assignments will always be accepted and assessed. However, point deduction for late assignments will be calculated as follows:

* less than two days late ==> 10% reduction
* less than seven days late ==> 30% reduction
* more than a week late ==> assignment will be assessed but no credit will be given :(

All assignments should be submitted to the appropriate **dropbox** in the Desire2Learn website for this course or to your github repository (as directed by instructor).

Assigned homework/programming assignments are to be strictly the work of each individual student unless a group assignment is specified.

## Policy on Shared Code
Assigned homework/programming assignments are to be strictly the work of each individual student. However, I encourage students to help each other and benefit from collaboration. This **DOES NOT** mean copying a fellow student's work and replacing their name with yours. I can spot this practice immediately and will not give credit to any submitted code that follows that pattern.

### Resolution:
If you and other students work together on a solution:

a. All parties must indicate in comments (at the top of submitted file) the nature of the collaboration, who was involved, and what was gained by the collaboration.

b. Your assignment cannot be a COPY of your collaborator's work. I want you to develop your own skills. You will not develop mad skills if you simply copy and paste or worse, *save as*...

c. Take (a) and (b) seriously.

#### How to collaborate? Discuss ideas, procedures, algorithms, and design in the abstract. The implementation is still up to you.

## How To Turn In Your Assignments

All homework submissions should include the following on the first two lines of your source file *as comments*:

>		<LAST NAME, FIRST NAME> <DATE>
>		<HOMEWORK #>

Your source files should be named to include your last name first initial followed by hw assignment number as demonstrated below. **DO NOT USE SPACES in file names please!**

#### Example file name:

>		medinar-hw1.py

#### Example python source file:

    # Medina, Richard 1-19-2016
    # Homework 999
    # I worked on the printmessage function with Guido. He showed me a way to format the string.

    def printmessage():
	    print('Hello. This is a sample program.')

    printmessage()
