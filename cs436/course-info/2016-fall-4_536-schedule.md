### 2016-08-30 Week 2

#### Readings
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/)

[jQuery quick start](https://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/)

#### Topics
- About HCI (John Carroll's intro)
- Guidelines, principles, and theories
- Contexts

#### Workshop: Coding the UI with HTML and javascript and jQuery

**A UI for gathering information from student applying for a job.**

1. Create a project folder for this workshop
2. Download the following and save to your project folder
	- [Basic HTML template]()
	- [jQuery library]()
3. Using html widgets, create an HTML form that gathers the following information from a student.
	- first and last name
	- today's date
	- gender
	- a paragraph describing why they want the job
	- preferred salary
	- years of prior experience
	- degree (associates, bachelors, masters, phd)
	- degree field (CS, Biology, etc.)

4. After submitting the form, the UI should present the information in a confirmation dialog (accepting or canceling the application)

#### 2016-08-23 Week 1 

#### Readings
[Human Computer Interaction - brief intro (before week 2)](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/human-computer-interaction-brief-intro)

#### Topics

- About the field of Human Computer Interaction
- Organization of the course
- A simple analytic framework
- Group: Paper/pencil evaluation of a UI
- Programming Pre-assessment (for those who haven't taken it yet)

#### Survey says ....
- How many of you have built a user interface and for what purpose?
- What was the scope? (a small aspect of a program or function or a comprehensive front-end to a large complex application)
- What was the scale? (used my MANY users or just a few or just YOU)

#### What is HCI?
- Probable answer A ==> *Programming the user interface so that a human can use our system.*
- Probable answer B ==> *Use an application library to code buttons, menus, and windows so that a human can use our system.*

*... but it's more nuanced than that!*

- a principled and carefully thought out approach (analysis!) to designing for humans and their capabilities
	* cognitive, physical, sensory, and (nowadays) social
- fundamentally **interdisciplinary**
	* psychology/cognitive science, software engineering, graphic design, behavioral sciences, business/economics, natural sciences
- field of **research** - people **write** dissertations in the field
	* Example: Dr. Medina's dissertation!
- field of **practice** - people **construct** UI's following principles and guidelines (*usually from research!*)
- so, HCI refers to a bunch of different concepts and it is evolving!
	
	BEFORE: single user systems, minimal networks, non-distributed (stand alone), closed
	
	NOW: collaborative systems, massive scale, distributed networks, open

	BEFORE: single db or data stores (non distributed)

	NOW: cloud storage, cloud services, distributed data, massive amount and **types!** of data - "big data"

where do we begin to deal with this evolution beyound windows, menus, and buttons? A single unifying abstraction, of course!

#### FUNDAMENTAL UNIFYING ABSTRACTION FOR THE COURSE

```TECHNOLOGY MEDIATION``` 

- mediating actions, thoughts, ideas, and joint (social) activity
- a continuum: 
	* low level to high level - action (a ```submit``` button) to thought and inquiry (analytics)
	* individual user to social network
	* personal data (contact list manager) to massive social data stores (voting analytics, twitter feeds) 

#### Organization of the course

**FOUNDATIONS**

	develop your understanding of HCI principles and techniques common to the field and to software engineering in general

**PRACTICE**
	
	learn how to use tools for designing and implementing interactive user interfaces for relatively large or complex data sets.

	appreciate the array of current technological capabilities for supporting mediation
	
	Examples ==> visualization, large data displays, interactivity, gesture, gaze and sound mediation.

**INTELLECTUAL**

	develop analytic skills for doing principled and carefully thought out UI development for mediating human computer interactions

#### A Simple Framework Classroom Exercise

1. Identify/characterize the user(s) or ```stakeholders``` of the NMHU (banner) online class schedule
2. Brainstorm and list potential ```goals``` the stakeholders may have regarding the system
3. For each goal, decide on a rating from 0 to five stars (five stars is highest rating) of how well the existing system meets that goal. This is subjective of course but let's start with our intuitions!
4. For at least one goal that received a poor rating, discuss among yourselves how you would improve it to elevate its rating.

#### Preassessment (if you haven't done this for me in another course this semester)

Python pre-assessment ==> [pretest.py]({{ site.baseurl }}assets/cs350/pretest.py)
