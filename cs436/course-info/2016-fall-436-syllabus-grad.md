## About This Course
From the course catalog ... 

This course investigates theory and practice in human-computer interaction. Students will study the impact of human perception and cognition on user interface design and learn to use tools for building graphical user interface (GUIs) and speech interfaces. In addition, each student will design and implement a user interface. Prerequisite: CS 516 with a minimum grade of C or permission of instructor.

## Intended Outcomes
* understand the role of analytic frameworks for designing user interfaces
* apply principles and techniques to the design and implementation of user interfaces
* understand and apply the use of toolkits and libraries for building and deploying user interfaces
* develop skills and techniques for implementing interactive user interfaces for large and/or complext information sets.
* develop a foundation for HCI and its relation to software engineering
* develop a critical understanding of ethics and security in user interface design
* develop a technical vocabulary for discussing HCI in technical settings
* understand the concept of mediation as it applys to UI design
* develop and demonstrate a deep understanding of one of many research oriented threads in HCI

## Course Requirements
0. **Regular (daily/weekly) access to NMHU Desire2Learn for this course is expected**
1. **Attendance/Participation is expected in both lecture and lab**. For grading purposes, attendance is computed as, total meetings - number of absences / total meetings
2. **Homework Assignments** - written and technical assignments usually one per week.
3. **Final project/research/presentation** - due towards the end of the course, details TBA
3. **Midterm and Final Exams** (comprehensive)


## Grading
* 10%	Attendance
* 20%	Homework Assignments (grading criteria indicated at the end of this syllabus)
* 30%	Final project/research/presentation
* 40%	Midterm/Final

## Homework Policy
It is expected that deadlines for assignments will be honored. Late assignments will always be accepted and assessed. However, point deduction for late assignments will be calculated as follows:

* less than two days late ==> 10% reduction
* less than seven days late ==> 30% reduction
* more than a week late ==> assignment will be assessed but no credit will be given :(
