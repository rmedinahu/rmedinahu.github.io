Midterm Review Sheet
----------

You are **highly** encouraged to review the following questions in preparation for the midterm exam. The review questions are in **two** pdf files linked below. I've highlighted the questions I want you to focus on. Each study guide also contains the answers to each question. Almost all of the questions can be answered using the assigned textbook. 

A few questions are related to topics not necessarily discussed in the text such as python programming assignments given during the last two months. 

The exam will be held March 10th during our regular class meeting.
