Final Review Sheet
----------

You are **highly** encouraged to review the following questions in preparation for the final exam. There are four sources of information for the review.
	
1. The midterm exam is available on d2l along with the correct answers. I will be reusing some of these questions!

2. The chapter study guides listed below (focus on chapters 3, 4, and 5). I've highlighted the review questions to focus on. The solutions to these questions are also part of each respective document.

3. The homework questions will be reused on the exam. Refer to the homework [page](/457/hw/) and their respective solutions. Focus on HWs 10 through 14.

4. Other concepts I think you should be able to address (see below).

Other Things You Should Know
---
A few questions are related to topics not necessarily discussed in the text at length.

- cipher/deciphering -- a basic cipher can be cracked. Why?
- What tactic is used to thwart an attacker from cracking a cipher (or encrypted data)?
- You should be able to understand the "day in the life a web page request". This scenario from chapter 5 moves through all layers. You should understand what is going in this scenario at each layer.
