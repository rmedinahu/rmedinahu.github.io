Midterm Review Sheet
----------

You are **highly** encouraged to review the following questions in preparation for the final exam. The review questions are in **seven** pdf files linked below. I've **HIGHLIGHTED** the questions I want you to focus on. Each study guide also contains the answers to each question. Almost all of the questions can be answered using the assigned textbook. 

A few questions are related to topics not necessarily discussed in the text such as python programming assignments given during the last two months.
