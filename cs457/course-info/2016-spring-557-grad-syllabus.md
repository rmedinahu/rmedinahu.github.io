## ABOUT THIS COURSE
See: [http://www.nmhu.edu/highlands-university-catalogs/](http://www.nmhu.edu/highlands-university-catalogs/)

A study of the major concepts of computer networking. Topics
discussed will include the Open System Interconnection
(OSI) model, data communication networking, computer
communications architectures and protocols as well as applications
including local area networks (LAN) and integrated services digital
network (ISDN). Cross-listed as: MIS 420.

[deviations from course catalog description]

*Primary focus will be on the Internet Protocol Stack rather than the full seven layer OSI model.*

## INTENDED OUTCOMES
* Practical understanding of the 5-layer internet protocol stack
* Ability to properly diagnose and solve network problems at the proper layer of the stack (network administration)
* Understand network architectures and topologies and their optimal application and relevant deficiencies
* Understand the diversity of network devices and their relevant implications for computer networks
* Understand the concepts and standards related to network security
* Practical understanding of application layer programming


## COURSE REQUIREMENTS
0. **Regular (daily/weekly) access to NMHU Desire2Learn for this course**
1. **Attendance/Participation is expected**. For grading purposes, attendance is computed as, total meetings - number of absences / total meetings

5. **Final Research or Technical Paper/Presentation to class**

## GRADING
* 10%	Attendance
* 40%	Weekly/Bi-weekly Homework
* 20%	Midterm Exam
* 30%	Final research paper AND presentation to class

## HOMEWORK POLICY
It is expected that deadlines for homework assignments will be honored. Late assignments will always be accepted and assessed. However, point deduction for late assignments will be calculated as follows:

* less than two days late ==> 10% reduction
* less than seven days late ==> 30% reduction
