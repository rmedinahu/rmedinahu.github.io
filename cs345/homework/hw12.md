### Hash Set Mapping

### Description
This homework exercise will allow you to explore the implementation of a simple hash table set using buckets. To do this you will start with hw_12_starter.py and proceed to implement the functions provided.

Start here: [hw_12_starter.py]({{ site.baseurl }}assets/cs345/hw_12_starter.py)

### Tasks:

#### A. Implement all methods except for the constructor in class HashSetTbl.

#### B. Test your 10-bucket table by adding a sufficient number words to your set to force the use of your buckets. For example you might take the following paragraph, parse it into words, then insert each word into your set. Note that your set class should not add duplicates.
