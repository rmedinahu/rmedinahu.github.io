### Benchmarking Iteration

### Description
This homework exercise will allow you to explore using a priority queue to manage jobs
for a high performance computing center. At this center jobs with the highest projected 
runtime have high priority. Your task is to modify file linked below make it a MAX heap (instead of a MIN heap).

Start here: [hw_10_priority_queue.py]({{ site.baseurl }}assets/cs345/hw_10_priority_queue.py)

### Tasks:

#### A. ClusterJob class
1. Overload the > operator in the ClusterJob class.

2. Complete the unit test to make sure cj objects are compared correctly. a > b.

#### B. BinHeap class
1. Turn this class into a max heap.
	- add ```delmax``` function that should return the cluster job with the highest runtime. See the ```delmin``` function for example.
	- modify ```percUp``` and ```percDown``` accordingly so that they ensure the heap stays in heap order (highest at top).

2. Complete the unit test to make sure the max heap always returns the highest runtime cluster job.

> Please test with at least 5 cluster job objects and verify they removed in highest to lowest order!


### Turn In:
Rename the source code file containing your version of the program according to syllabus.
