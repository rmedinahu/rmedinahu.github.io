### Max Heap Priority Queue

### Description
This homework exercise will allow you to explore using a priority queue to manage jobs
for a high performance computing center. At this center jobs with the highest projected 
runtime have high priority. Your task is to modify the file linked below to make it a MAX heap (instead of a MIN heap).

Start here: [hw_10_priority_queue.py]({{ site.baseurl }}assets/cs345/hw_10_priority_queue.py)

### Tasks:

#### A. ClusterJob class
1. Overload the > operator in the ClusterJob class using the load factor for each object.

2. Complete the unit test to make sure ClusterJob objects are compared correctly. a > b.

#### B. BinHeapList class and Unit Tests
1. Turn the BinHeapList class into a max heap.
	- add ```delmax``` function that should return the cluster job with the highest runtime. See the ```delmin``` function for example.
	- modify ```percUp``` and ```percDown``` accordingly so that they ensure the heap stays in heap order (highest at top).
    - add ```maxChildIndex``` function to determine the index of the largest child of parent p. See ```minChildIndex``` for an example that returns the index of the smallest child of parent p. **Remember to call maxChildIndex at the appropriate location of the code.**

2. Complete the unit test to make sure the max heap always returns the highest runtime cluster job.

> Please test with at least 5 cluster job objects and verify they removed in highest to lowest order! You will want to insert job objects, then delete them (delmax function) to verify that the heap is deleting largest to the smallest items in order.
