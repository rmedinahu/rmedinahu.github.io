### Python Primer 3


### Description
For this programming assignment, you are going to design and implement a class that partially replicates the behavior of the python class *Set*. Your set can store any data type that can be hashed.

From python ...

>[A set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects. Common uses include membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and computing mathematical operations such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference.](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset)


### Requirements
- Your *set* class CANNOT use python's *set* class but it must **behave** like the python *set* class... HINT: you could use the ```dict``` class (creatively) or roll your own hash value list.

- Your *set* class must implement the following methods:
	- ```__init__(self)``` *contructor* should take an optional list argument to initialize the internal data structure. If no argument is provided, the set is initially empty.
	
	- ```__repr__(self)``` Returns a string representation of the set.
	
	- ```add(elem)``` Add element elem to the set only if it is unique to the set.

	- ```addSeq(self, seq)``` Add contents of ```seq``` to the set where each item in contents is unique to the set.

	- ```remove(self, elem)``` Removes and returns the element elem from the set. Raises ```KeyError``` if elem is not contained in the set.

	- ```get(self, elem)``` Returns element elem from the set. Raises ```KeyError``` if elem is not contained in the set.

	- ```clear(self)``` Remove all elements from the set.
	
	- ```size(self)``` Returns the size of the set.
	

- You will need to write your own test cases for your class that TEST all methods! For example, at the bottom of your class definition you would have the following (plus more tests of course!):

{% highlight python %}
if __name__ == '__main__':
	setobj = MySet([6, 8, 3, 6])
	print setobj
	# Should print something like 3, 6, 8 (note the uniqueness of 6?)
{% endhighlight python %}

### What to Turn In?
- Your single class definition file following the naming conventions required in the syllabus.
