### Iterators and Breadth First Search 

### Description
This homework exercise will allow you to explore adding an iterator to a class to print a binary tree in breadth first order. See the following to get started.

Start here: [hw_11_starter.py]({{ site.baseurl }}assets/cs345/hw_11_starter.py)

### Tasks:

#### A. BinaryTree in hw_11_starter.py
1. Implement ```bforder()``` as a generator that yields each element in the tree in breadth first order.

2. Implement ```build_tree``` so it loads the data in list into the tree. See code for more info.
