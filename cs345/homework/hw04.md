### Python Primer 4: Objects, Files, and Data


### Description
For this programming assignment, you are going to design and implement a class that models cars. To test your car class, you will need to open and read a *json* encoded file containing data about cars. For each *json* item you will create a Car object with the information in the json object then store the new object in a list. Thus, after reading the file your test program should have an array of "car objects". Below are the requirements for your Car class as well as your test program.

### Requirements for your Car class
- Your **Car** class maintains three attributes (year, make, and odometer reading). Attributes must be private: ```self._year```
- Your **Car** class must implement the following methods:

	- ```__init__(self)``` *contructor* should take three parameters corresponding to each attribute. Please provide default values.
	
	- ```__repr__(self)``` Returns a string representation of the Car.
	
	- ```get_year(self)``` Returns the year attribute of a car object.

	- ```get_make(self)``` Returns the make attribute of a car object.

	- ```get_odometer(self)``` Returns the odometer attribute of a car object.

	- ```get_status(self)``` Returns "NEW" (odometer < 50K), "USED" (odometer < 150K), or "JUNK" (odometer >= 150K) depending on the odometer value. 
	
### Requirements for your Test Program
1. Open and read in (as json) the file entitled ```data.txt```

Download [data.txt]({{ site.baseurl }}assets/cs345/data.txt)

2. For each json item in the data, create a car object with data points in the object then add the car object to a list.

3. Once you have loaded your list, implement the following functions:
	
	a. Determine then print the average odometer reading from all the car objects in the list. Must produce floating point result.
	
	b. Compute then print the most frequent make in the car data list.
	
	c. Compute then print the least frequent make in the car data list.
	
	d. Compute then print the most frequent ocurring status. E.g., "The data contains mostly USED cars."



### What to Turn In?
- Your single class definition file following the naming conventions required in the syllabus.
- Your class definition and your test program should be in the same file.

### Hints:
- Reading in a json file will require the use of the ```json``` module. Import this at the top of your program. You can then use ```json.loads(string)``` to read in a json string and convert it to a python list of dictionary items.

{% highlight python %}
import json

json_data = json.loads(somejsonencodedstringhere)

{% endhighlight python %}

- each json object contains information for a single car. You can access this like you would a dictionary:

{% highlight python %}

c = {"status": 99634, "make": "Infiniti", "year": 2012}
print c['status'] # prints 99634

{% endhighlight python %}


{% highlight python %}
# Example: open a json encoded file for reading, then decode with json.
fp = open('data.txt', 'r')
s = fp.read()
jin = json.loads(s) # this decodes into python data structure

# jin is an actual python list containing dictionaries.
# This can handled with python list processing techniques
for i in jin:
	print i['year']
{% endhighlight python %}
