### 2017-01-23 Week 2 

#### Readings
- **CHAPTER 1** ==> DSAP (Data Structures and Algorithms in Python)

##### Additional reference:
[python scope and namespace](http://www.python-course.eu/passing_arguments.php)

[python data structures](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#)

#### Note on ```mutability/immutability``` and ```pass-by-value/pass-by-reference```.

##### FACT 1: Python passes all arguments by reference.

##### FACT 2: Data types in python are either ```mutable``` or ```immutable```.

##### GIVES THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS:
If an **immutable** type is passed as an argument to a function, it is passed by reference. However, because the argument is **immutable** it cannot be reassigned a value. Thus, any modification to the argument is necessarily a **COPY**. This effectively indicates that **immutable** types are **passed by value**.

If a **mutable** type is passed as an argument to a function, it is passed by reference. Therefore, it can be modified directly. This follows the behavior consistent with what we mean by **pass-by-reference**.


#### Topics
- Python primer (variables, conditionals, iteration)
- mutability/immutability
- scope and namespace
- pass by value vs. pass by reference 
- review homework 1
