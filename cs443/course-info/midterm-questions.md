CS 443 Midterm
----------

2016-03-07

*Instructions*

In a separate text file, provide responses to the following questions. When done, save the text file with your name in the filename and upload to D2L midterm drop box. Please submit your responses by **Thursday March 10 @ 9pm**. 

You may use any materials available to answer the questions.


Chapter 01
----------
1. a) What are system calls? b) Name and briefly describe two system calls.

2. a) Name three different kinds of operating systems in the operating system "zoo" b) Briefly describe one of them.

3. What is meant by a trap instruction?

4. What are key differences between kernel mode and user mode in a layered operating system?


Chapter 02
----------
5. What is a process and why is it a central concept in operating systems?

6. How are processess typically created?

7. What are the three main process states?

8. What is meant by the term *multiprogramming* and how is it related to the concept of *process management*?

9. What is a thread and why do we need them?

10. How are processes and threads different and how are they the same?

11. Why do we consider kernel trap instructions as incurring a relatively high performance cost?

12. Describe the general sequence of events that make up a process switch?

13. What is a race condition? Briefly describe a scenario where this condition could be met and how it could be prevented.

14. If you mentioned *critical region* in your previous answer, briefly explain how we implement such regions. If you didn't mention *critical region*, then please revisit your previous answer.

15. What is a semaphore?

16. Describe an example of a *cpu bound* and an example of an *i/o bound* process. Why would it be important for a scheduling algorithm to "know" this process characterization?

17. How does the **Dining Philophers Problem** relate to interprocess communication? Hint: I would consider mentioning *semaphores* in your response.

18. What is a mutex?

19. Name one scheduling algorithm listed in the chapter and indicate in which operating system context that algorithm is best suited.

20. Please give an educated response as to why the use of python threads for a cpu-bound process takes nearly three times as long as the same process in a *non-threaded* python program.
