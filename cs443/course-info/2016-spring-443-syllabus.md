## ABOUT THIS COURSE
See: [http://www.nmhu.edu/highlands-university-catalogs/](http://www.nmhu.edu/highlands-university-catalogs/)

This course is a study of the concepts associated with the modern operating system. Topics will include supervisors, command processors, device drivers, interrupt handlers, queue managers, resource managers, memory allocation schemes, process activation and control, and timesharing or multitask control. Prerequisite: CS 341 with minimum, grade of C.   

[My take]
Operating systems are deeply complex and are composed of interesting dilemmas relevant to the diverse array of curiosities existing among computer scientists. The OS represents one of the hallmarks of our field -- the control and management of electrical pulses on one hand and the interface between machines and human knowledge on the other. Because of this, the study of operating systems is as much about an understanding of natural/physical phenomena as it is about human design decisions and ideas developed to make something much more. The intellectual goal of this course is to give students a sense of appreciation of this feat -- how and why it works in the many and fascinating ways that it does (and perhaps does not or not as well as we would like).


## INTENDED OUTCOMES
* a technical understanding of the basic design and organization of modern operating systems
* an appreciation and critical understanding of OS design components and underlying concepts
* an understanding of the relationship between machine design and OS design

## COURSE REQUIREMENTS
0. **Regular (daily/weekly) access to NMHU Desire2Learn for this course**
1. **Attendance/Participation is expected**. For grading purposes, attendance is computed as, total meetings - number of absences / total meetings
2. **Readings** - You will be expected to participate in in-class discussions based on assigned readings from required textbook and other sources as assigned.
3. **Homework** - assigned based on current readings and other technical tasks
4. **Midterm and Final Exams** (comprehensive)

## GRADING
* 10%	Attendance
* 40%	Weekly/Bi-weekly Homework
* 50%	Midterm/Final

## HOMEWORK POLICY
It is expected that deadlines for homework assignments will be honored. Late assignments will always be accepted and assessed. However, point deduction for late assignments will be calculated as follows:

* less than two days late ==> 10% reduction
* less than seven days late ==> 30% reduction
* more than a week late ==> assignment will be assessed but no credit will be given :(
