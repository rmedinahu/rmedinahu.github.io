Due: May 9 before 3pm. Submit your report on one OS related vulnerability.
----

**This assignment asks you to choose one of the software exploitations from section 9.7 in the text (there are seven) and write up a short explanation, in your own words, of the attack. I would like you to identify the vulnerability exposed by the attack and potential remedies to prevent it. You can use figures and diagrams. A minimum of 2-4 paragraphs is adequate. A page is too long!**
