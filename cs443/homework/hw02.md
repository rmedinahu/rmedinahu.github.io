**Page Replacement Algorithms**

Please answer questions ```7, 29, 30, 32, 36``` from chapter 3 of text. Submit responses in text file to D2L.

7. (a) 8212. (b) 4100. (c) 24684.

29. The first page with a 0 bit will be chosen, in this case D.

30. The counters are Page 0: 0110110
Page 1: 01001001 Page 2: 00110111 Page 3: 10001011

32. The age of the page is 2204 − 1213 = 991. If τ = 400, it is definitely out of the working set and was not recently referenced so it will be evicted. The τ = 1000 situation is different. Now the page falls within the working set (barely), so it is not removed.

36. NRU removes page 2. FIFO removes page 3. LRU removes page 1. Second
chance removes page 2.
