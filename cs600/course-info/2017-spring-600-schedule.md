### Research Papers/Videos

#### Security 
- [Where is cybercrime really coming from? (video)](http://www.ted.com/talks/caleb_barlow_where_is_cybercrime_really_coming_from?utm_source=tedcomshare&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tedspread)

> **the economy or "marketplace" for computer security criminals**

> **NEW Approach: change the economics for the bad guys?**

> ** published 700 terabytes of actionable threat intelligence data, including information on real-time attacks that can be used to stop cybercrime in its tracks. And to date, over 4,000 organizations are leveraging this data, including half of the Fortune 100.**

#### Machine Learning
- ['Weapons Of Math Destruction' Outlines Dangers Of Relying On Data Analytics (audio)](http://www.npr.org/2016/09/12/493654950/weapons-of-math-destruction-outlines-dangers-of-relying-on-data-analytics
)


> **So in some sense, it's really not the algorithm's fault at all. It's, in a large way, the way we apply algorithms and the way we trust them that is the problem.**

> **people just trust numbers, they trust scores**

> **worrisome algorithms:**

	1. high impact
	2. opaque
	3. destructive


- [Accountability in Machine Learning (pdf)]({{ site.baseurl }}assets/cs600/p56-diakopoulos.pdf)

> In the face of important or expensive errors, discrimination, unfair denials of public services, or censorship, when and how should algorithms be reined in?

> **prioritize, classify, associate, and  filter**

> **One issue with the church of big data is its overriding faith in correlation as king. "Correlation does not equal causation"**

> **algorithms are largely unregulated now, and they are indeed exercising power over individuals or policies in a way that in some cases (for example, hidden government watch lists) lacks any accountability whatsoever.** recidivism???

> **Freedom of Information Processing Act**

- What do we do? 
	- transparency
	- allow adjustments to false positives
	- publicly submitted benchmark datasets
- What to disclose in the spirit of *transparency*?

> **human involvement, data, the model, inferencing, and algorithmic presence.**

- Who's running the algorithm? ==> attribution
- What is the data, is it accurate, valid, relevant, etc.?
- How is algorithm modeled? Eg., How does the Growth Model work?
- Inference testing. Use multiple and diverse datasets to benchmark an algorithm's results.
- Transparency: algorithmic presence. What's it watching and what is not watching...

> **machine to human explainers?**


#### Topics From the Readings/Video:
- growth model
- predictive policing
- recidivism risk scoring
- automated writing algorithms
- algorithm transparency
- gaming the algorithm
- cybersecurity as health/disease pandemics
- threat intelligenc: how is it used, processed, made actionable?
