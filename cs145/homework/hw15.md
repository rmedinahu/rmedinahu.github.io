**Please answer the following questions after downloading or viewing the source code listed here:[RandomMosaicWalk.java](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/source/chapter4/RandomMosaicWalk.java)**

1. In your own words, please describe the idea and purpose of the ```RandomMosaicWalk``` program. It is discussed in the text [here](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c4/s6.html).

2. How many static methods are defined for the ```RandomMosaicWalk``` class?

3. How many of those methods are fruitful?

4. What is the **variable scope** of the variable named ```directionNum```?

5. What is the **variable scope** of the variables named  ```currentRow``` and ```currentColumn```?

**Answers**

1. The purpose of the RandomMosaicWalk program is to display grid of randomly colored squares. While the program is running, different squares are changed to random color. The program runs until the user closes the window containing the mosaic.

2. 4 static methods including ```main```. The member properties are also static but they are properties!

3. None are fruitful.

4. The scope of ```directionNum``` is only within the method ```randomMove()```

5. The scope of ```currentRow``` and ```currentColumn``` is within the ENTIRE class ```RandomMosaicWalk```. This makes these variables known throughout all of the methods including main.
