Homework 16
----

Due: Apr 22 before 10am. Submit **only** your version of RandomMosaicWalk.java to D2L. 
----

*(I will use the textbook versions of Mosaic and MosaicPanel to grade your program. So don't modify those files!)*

**For this homework you are going to modify the the [RandomMosaicWalk.java](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/source/chapter4/RandomMosaicWalk.java) program. The modification is as follows. (1) Instead of filling the entire mosaic with randomly colored cells your modification will fill all the cells with the color white at startup. Second, instead of iteratively choosing a random color to fill the next (randomly selected) cell, you will fill each cell with the color of your choice and you will use only this color for coloring the cells as you randomly walk the mosaic.**

1. Make sure you can run the RandomMosaicWalk without modifications.
2. Begin your modifications by renaming ```RandomMosaicWalk.java``` to ```<Your initials>RandomMosaicWalk.java``` and remember to rename your class accordingly.
3. You modifications should only need to be made in ```RandomMosaicWalk.java```. Focus on adding appropriate ```static``` methods to meet the requirements specified above.
