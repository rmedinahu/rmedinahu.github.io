Homework 18
----

Due: May 6 before 5pm. Submit files to GitHub repository. In other words, ```push``` your changes to your repository. I will grade the code located in your repository.
----

**In [lab 12](http://rmedinahu.github.io/145/lab12/) you should have already cloned and began modifying the files required for this assignment. To complete the assignment you are asked to implement the methods in MyPortfolio.java. The file PortfolioApp.java file will run and test your methods. The goal is to get all of the methods to ```pass``` their tests.** 

Note 1: you should not have to modify PortfolioApp.java. It will run and call the methods in MyPortfolio.java. If you have implemented those methods correctly, then all tests should pass.

Note 2: if you need a fresh copy of the assignment you can ```fork``` from [https://github.com/rmedinahu/cs145-portfolio](https://github.com/rmedinahu/cs145-portfolio) to your repository. Then, as noted in lab 12, you can clone from your repo to your working directory (your computer).
