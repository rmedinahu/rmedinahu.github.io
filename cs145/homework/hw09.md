>	position() # method that returns the (x, y) coordinate of the turtle

**Turtle Aquarium**

For this program you are going to write a simple turtle python program that allows a turtle to move left and right within the window but it can never escape the aquarium.

Assume the following about the aquarium:

>	the leftmost edge is at coordinate -300
>	the rightmost edge is at coordinate 300

The turtle should move left to right. When it reaches either edge it must immediately move in the opposite direction. The turtle can move at whatever ```speed``` you wish it to move. 

The turtle moves indefinitely within the aquarium.
