**Note: The following program description was previously a lab problem from [Lab 5 Feb 19](/145/lab05/).**


You are going to write a program that accepts two pieces of input from the user: a width and a height of a rectangle. Your program should then print the ascii art of the rectangle as specified by width and height. You are required to write a function that will do this for any sized rectangle. Name this function ```rascii``` 

*How many arguments should the ```rascii``` function have?*


**HINT**: You can do the art with three loops (one to print the top, one to print the height, and one to print the bottom). 

For example, a rectangle that is 5 by 7 could be printed on the console as follows:

>	- - - - -
>	|       |
>	|       |
>	|       |
>	|       |
>	|       |
>	|       |
>	|       |
>	- - - - -
