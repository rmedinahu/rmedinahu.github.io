2.1

Weâ€™ve seen that n = 42 is legal. What about  42 = n?

**variable on the left hand side of assignment is legal. assigning a variable to a literal is a syntax error. python treats the 42 as a variable which cannot begin with a number**

Howabout  x = y = 1? **legal. 1 is assigned to variable y, y is assigned to variable x. variable always on the left of assignment operator. 

In some languages every statement ends with a semi-colon, ; . What happens if you put a semi-colon at the end of a Python statement?

**ignored**

What if you put a period at the end of a statement? **syntax errir**

In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: xy. What happens if you try that in Python?

**python treats xy as a variable name**

[1] The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3 pi r^3. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?

	pi = 3.14159265359
	r = 5
	v = 4/3.0 * pi * 5 ** 3
	print v

[2] Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?

	total_cost = 24.95 * 60
	total_cost = total_cost - total_cost * .40
	shipping = 3 + 59 * .75
	total_cost = total_cost + shipping
	print total_cost


**$945.45**


[3] If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?

	depart = (6 * 3600) + (52 * 60)
	rate_1 = 8*60+15  # seconds per mile
	rate_2 = 7*60+12  # seconds per mile

	elapsed = (rate_1 * 2) + (rate_2 * 3) 

	arrive = depart + elapsed

	arrival_hour = arrive / 3600
	arrival_mins = arrive % 3600 / 60

	print arrival_hour, ':',  arrival_mins 

**7 : 30 am**
