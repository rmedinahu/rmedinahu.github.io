Solution 1.2
----
	
	secs = 42*60+42
	miles = 10/1.61

	# 60 seconds in one minute
	mins_per_mile = (secs/miles) / 60
	secs_per_mile = (secs/miles) % 60

	# 3600 seconds in one hour
	miles_per_hour = miles/3600.0

	print('1. number of seconds \n' + str(secs))
	print('\n\n2. number of miles \n' + str(miles))
	print('\n\n3a. time per mile \n' + str(mins_per_mile) + ' mins ' + str(secs_per_mile) + ' seconds')
	print('\n\n3b. miles per hour \n' + str(miles_per_hour))
