# Homework 4 Starter

# Write your (three) function definitions (fruitful) below this line so that the function calls at the bottom will work!

def add(x, y):
	return x + y

def sub(x, y):
	return x - y

def mul(x, y):
	return x * y


# Main flow -- function calls. Don't modify this section!

print add(24, 10)
print sub(24, 10)
print mul(24, 10)

print 'You have successfully defined three functions!'
