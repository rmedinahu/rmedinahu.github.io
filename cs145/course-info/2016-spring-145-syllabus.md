## About This Course
From the course catalog ... ([view](http://its.nmhu.edu/IntranetUploads/003477-15-17_catalo-925201511905.pdf))

This course is an introduction to object-oriented programming with software engineering emphasis. Major emphasis is placed on object-oriented programming techniques with focus on encapsulation and simple data structures implemented with classes and arrays. Prerequisite: Math 120 with a minimum grade of C, or an ACT score of 24, or permission of instructor.   

## Intended Outcomes
* Understand the concepts of high level programming languages
* Understand the concept of problem solving utilizing a computer programming language 
* Understand and apply basic programming skills
* Understand and apply object-oriented programming skills
* Understand Java programming language syntax and semantics
* Impart basic familiarity with the Python programming language
* Impart good problem solving/critical thinking skills
* Impart good programming methods/etiquette

## Course Requirements
0. **Regular (daily/weekly) access to NMHU Desire2Learn for this course is expected**
1. **Attendance/Participation is expected in both lecture and lab**. For grading purposes, attendance is computed as, total meetings - number of absences / total meetings
2. **Programming Assignments** - a minimum of one program is assigned (and due) per week.
3. **Quizzes** - short online quizzes will be given weekly or every two weeks
4. **Midterm and Final Exams** (comprehensive)

## Grading
* 10%	Attendance
* 15%	Quizzes
* 40%	Programming Assignments (grading criteria indicated at the end of this syllabus)
* 35%	Midterm/Final

## Homework Policy
It is expected that deadlines for programming assignments will be honored. Late assignments will always be accepted and assessed. However, point deduction for late assignments will be calculated as follows:

* less than two days late ==> 10% reduction
* less than seven days late ==> 30% reduction
* more than a week late ==> assignment will be assessed but no credit will be given :(

All programming assignments should be submitted to the appropriate **dropbox** in the Desire2Learn website for this course.

Assigned homework/programming assignments are to be strictly the work of each individual student unless a group assignment is specified.

## Grading Criteria for Programming Assignments
* Each assigned program is worth 100 points. The criteria is as follows:

	* 30 points = Contains no syntax errors (it **COMPILES**) 
	* 20 points = **EXECUTES** without runtime errors 
	* 40 points = Program is **CORRECT** (performs as specified by instructions)
	* 5  points = Source code format follows acceptable style guidelines (indentation, whitespace, etc.) 
	* 5  points = **SUBMITTED ON TIME**

## How To Turn In Your Programming Assignments

All programming submissions should include the following on the first two lines of your source file *as comments*:

>		<LAST NAME, FIRST NAME> <DATE>
>		<HOMEWORK #>


#### Example java source file:
		
    // Medina, Richard 1-19-2016
    // Homework 999

    public class SampleProgram {
	    public static void main(String[] args) {
		    System.out.println("Hello. This is a sample program.")
	    }
    }


#### Example python source file:

    # Medina, Richard 1-19-2016
    # Homework 999

    def printmessage():
	    print('Hello. This is a sample program.')

    printmessage()
    
## A Note About CS145 Lab
Lab is intended to give you the opportunity to work out concepts and skills related to the weekly topics addressed in lecture. I take the approach that the lab is open to collaboration among students (help each other, ask each other). The Instructor and/or the Teaching Assistant are there to provide additional help and feedback during each lab session.
