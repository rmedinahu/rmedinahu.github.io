<section data-markdown>

The "Basics": Our First Five Weeks
----
- input *get data into our programs*
- output *push data out of our programs*
- math *perform arithmetic calculations* ==> **add**, **sub**, **mult**, **divide**, **compare**
- conditionals *check for certain conditions ==> **x > 99** ? then perform one instruction instead of another*
- repetition/iteration *compute an instruction multiple times*

The *Machine* We Are Programming
----
- Central Processing Unit ==> CPU
- Memory ==> RAM
- I/O devices (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, printer, screen, file, etc.)
- Permanent Storage

The Computer Program
----
- One or more simple instructions that are executed by a computer in sequence until last instruction is executed.
- Represents a solution to a problem. Examples?
- Any problem **MUST** be broken down into smaller chunks of statements that can expressed as an instruction. Examples?

How Programs Get Executed
----
1. Programmer develops a solution to a problem that can be computed.
2. Programmer expresses (writes, types) the solution in the form of a **sequence** of instructions
3. Programmer runs a special program that converts their solution to a set of codes that are executable by the machine.
4. Programmer then **runs** the executable codes to observe the behavior of their solution.
5. Programmer (invariably) returns to their program to make modifications and repeat the process of compile and execute.

Operators: What a Computer Can Do With Data
----
- Arithmetic
- Comparison

<section data-markdown>
Variables, Types, & Values: The root of the program
----
- variable is used by the programmer to *store* values
- variables have:
	- a **type** : the kind of value it can store. **Why**? 
	- hava a **value**. **Examples?**
	- variables can change during the execution of the program. **This is a powerful capability!**
- types: help the computer *know* how to use operators with variables. Examples?
- values
	- numbers, fractions (floating point numbers)
	- character
	- characters
	- bit strings
