### Simple Queue With ArrayList


### Description

READ ==> [Chapter 9 Section 3 on Queues](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c9/s3.html#recursion.3.2).

You are going to implement a simple queue ADT that stores ```Integers``` (First In First Out). The API for this implementation is as follows:

{% highlight java %}
void enqueue(int N) // Add N to the back of the queue.

int dequeue() // Remove the item at the front and return it.

boolean isEmpty() // Return true if the queue is empty.

void print() // Print each item in the queue beginning with the *HEAD*

{% endhighlight %}

#### Your class should use an ArrayList as its internal data structure. 

#### Write your own ```main``` method that tests your API.

#### Here's the Java API for: [ArrayList](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html)


** SUBMIT ONE FILE PLEASE!!! ** Your queue class with a main method as indicated above.
