### Simple Stack With ArrayList


### Description

**Again**, [READ chapter 7 especially section 7.3](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c7/index.html). **Next**, Modify your stack from [Homework 5](/245/hw5) so that it implements an ```ArrayList``` _instead of_ a **primitive** array. You should only modify the following:

1. the internal data property so that it is an instance of ArrayList
2. modify your ```pop()``` method from hw5 (see below).
3. remove your ```expand()``` method from YOUR class.
4. modify your ```getCapacity``` method to return the *size* of the stack (e.g., the number items currently stored in the data structure).

Here's the Java API for **ArrayList**:

[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html)


** SUBMIT ONE FILE PLEASE!!! Your stack class with a main method as indicated below.

#### Modifying ```pop()``` Method:

The ```pop()``` method from your previous version should be modified so that it **removes** the item being popped. See ```remove()``` method in the ArrayList API and chapter 7.3 in the online text.


#### Hw6 Test Code

1. Copy and paste the main method below into your stack class.
2. Replace the reference to my class so that it references yours.
3. Compile and run your stack class to check your implementation.

> NOTE:  You should not modify any part of the main method below EXCEPT for the name of the stack class referenced!
