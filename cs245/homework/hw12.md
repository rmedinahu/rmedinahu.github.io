### User Input and the Insertion Sort


### Description

READ ==> [Chapter 7.4](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c7/s4.html#arrays.4.3).

[INFO ON INSERTION SORT](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/SortSearch/TheInsertionSort.html) - *ALERT:* the explanation given on the linked page demonstrates the algorithm using python. The algorithm is the same for Java. I just like their explanation...

You are going to write a class called InsertionPoints again. You are building this class to familiarize yourself with the **insertion** sort. Most of the methods you can take from your work on [Homework 9](/245/hw9) and [Homework 11](/245/hw11) A solution to homework 11 is not available yet. A solution to homework 9 is provided on the homework sheet for your convenience. Note, you will still be working with a vector of (integer) data points. You will need to add functionality to ```main()``` so that it can accept user input from the command line. Place this code at the end of the test cases in ```main()```. 


Use the Scanner object for user input:

{% highlight java %}

import java.util.Scanner

Scanner userin = new Scanner(System.in);

// Display a prompt:
System.out.print("Enter an integer please: ");

// to read what integer was entered:
int a = userin.nextInt();

// to read a char:
System.out.print("Enter a letter please: ");

// to read what char was entered:
char b = userin.next().charAt(0);


{% endhighlight%}

>	Note: The insertion sort can operate on a sorted list (insert new items in correct sorted order) or can be implemented to sort an unordered list. For this assignment, you can assume an existing list is already sorted and you are to make sure to insert new items in correct sorted order.


#### ```insert()``` is the new addition to API for InsertionPoints

The InsertionPoints class needs an additional property to maintain the number of items in the array (not the size of the array). You will need to add this property and make sure to update it when inserting!

Declare the internal data structure ```data``` to be of size 200.


{% highlight java %}
/* 
This class does not have a constructor defined. (It will use a DEFAULT constructor provided by Java. You still need to instantiate it though! E.g. InsertionPoints())
*/


/* 
COPY BY VALUE, the data in initialData to the internal data structure for
this class.
*/
public void loadData(int[] initialData)


/* 
Performs a BINARY SEARCH for the given parameter in the data 
returning the index of the first occurence or -1 if not found.
*/
public int find(int q)


/*
Sorts the data in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm.
Returns the total number of exchanges made.
*/
public int selectionSort()


/*
Inserts a new integer into the array at its correct position to maintain sorted order.
*/
public void insert()


{% endhighlight %}

#### Your class should use a primitive array as its internal data structure. 

#### Use the following main method to test your implementation of the new DataPoints API.
