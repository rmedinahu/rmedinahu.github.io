### Comparing Bubble and Selection Sorts


### Description

READ ==> [Chapter 7.5](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c7/s5.html).

[INFO ON SELECTION SORT](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/SortSearch/TheBubbleSort.html) - *ALERT:* the explanation given on the linked page demonstrates the algorithm using python. The algorithm is the same for Java. I just like their explanation...

You are going to write a class called DataPoints again. You are building this class to familiarize yourself with the **selection** sort and compare its behavior to the **bubble** sort. Most of the methods you can take from your work on [Homework 9](/245/hw8). A solution to that homework is provided on the homework sheet for your convenience. Note, you will still be working with a vector of (integer) data points.


#### The new addition to the API for DataPoints

{% highlight java %}
/* 
This class does not have a constructor defined. (It will use a DEFAULT constructor provided by Java. You still need to instantiate it though! E.g. DataPoints())
*/


/* 
COPY BY VALUE, the data in initialData to the internal data structure for
this class.
*/
public void loadData(int[] initialData)


/* 
Performs a BINARY SEARCH for the given parameter in the data 
returning the index of the first occurence or -1 if not found.
*/
public int find(int q)


/* 
Performs a linear search for the given parameter returning 
a relevance score or ratio. A relevance score is simply: number of occurences
of query / number of items in the dataset. 

Returns a double.
*/
public double findrelevance(int q)


/* NEW NAME for the sort method...
Sorts the data in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
Returns the total number of exchanges made.
*/
public int bubbleSort()


/*
Sorts the data in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm.
Returns the total number of exchanges made.
*/
public int selectionSort()

#### Your class should use a primitive array as its internal data structure. 

#### Use the following main method to test your implementation of the new DataPoints API.
