### **[SOLUTION](#solution)** Handling The Unexpected

### Description

READ ==> [Chapter 8.3](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c8/s3.html).

Begin with your solution to [homework 12](/245/hw12) or use the solution I have provided (see hw 12). I would like you to add ```try```/ ```catch``` exceptions to the main method provided below. Be sure to carefully read the code again to make sure you understand how it works. The goal is to make it complete without crashing. It should handle runtime errors.

## REMEMBER TO REPLACE THE MAIN METHOD IN HW12 WITH THE MAIN METHOD LISTED BELOW...

#### Specifically:
**A:** the program must be robust againt malformed data.

**B:** the program is robust against bad user input. If bad user input is detected the program must continue to allow the user to reenter VALID data before continuing. 

#### Hints:
There are **two** locations in the code that will require a try/catch block. The first you can detect by running the program after only modifying which class to use (presumably your class replaces mine...). The **runtime** error tells you which line to **WRAP** in a try catch block. The challenge here is deduce what to do in the catch block to fix and continue with the other tests. 

### NOTE: I want you to understand the program and understand WHY the runtime error is being generated. So, do analysis and determine the source of the problem. The fix should be easy AND it should be implemented in your catch clause...


The second location that requires a try/catch block is spelled out for you in the code. We also discussed this in class. You'll figure it out.
