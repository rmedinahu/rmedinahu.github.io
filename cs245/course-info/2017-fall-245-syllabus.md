## Course Requirements
0. **Regular (daily/weekly) access to NMHU Desire2Learn for this course is expected**
1. **Attendance/Participation is expected in both lecture and lab**. For grading purposes, attendance is computed as, total meetings - number of absences / total meetings
2. **Programming Assignments** - a minimum of one program is assigned (and due) per week.
3. **Quizzes** - short online quizzes will be given weekly or every two weeks. This includes two programming competency exams.
4. **Midterm and Final Exams** (comprehensive)

## Grading
* 10%	Attendance
* 10%	Quizzes
* 40%	Programming Assignments (grading criteria indicated at the end of this syllabus)
* 40%	Midterm/Final/Competency Exams

## Homework Policy
It is expected that deadlines for programming assignments will be honored. Late assignments will always be accepted and assessed. However, point deduction for late assignments will be calculated as follows:

* less than two days late ==> 10% reduction
* less than seven days late ==> 30% reduction
* more than a week late ==> assignment will be assessed but no credit will be given :(

All programming assignments should be submitted to the appropriate **dropbox** in the Desire2Learn website for this course or to your github repository (as directed by instructor).

Assigned homework/programming assignments are to be strictly the work of each individual student unless a group assignment is specified. The parties involved will be warned after the first and second instances. After the third instance, zero credit will be given. Continued abuse will result in execution of the NMHU plagiarism policies.

## Grading Criteria for Programming Assignments
* Each assigned program is worth 100 points. The criteria is as follows:

	* 30 points = Contains no syntax errors (it **COMPILES**) 
	* 20 points = **EXECUTES** without runtime errors 
	* 40 points = Program is **CORRECT** (performs as specified by instructions)
	* 5  points = Source code format follows acceptable style guidelines (indentation, whitespace, etc.) 
	* 5  points = **SUBMITTED ON TIME**

## How To Turn In Your Programming Assignments

All programming submissions should include the following on the first two lines of your source file *as comments*:

>		<LAST NAME, FIRST NAME> <DATE>
>		<HOMEWORK #>

Your source files should be named to include your last name first initial followed by hw assignment number as demonstrated below. **DO NOT USE SPACES in file names please!**
