### Super Simple Database: Enrollment Analytics II

### Materials ==> You may start fresh ([hw05-enrollment-db.zip]({{ site.baseurl }}assets/cs431/hw05-enrollment-db.zip)) or build on your completed work from hw 5 (recommended).

### Description
A. Reuse the enrollment analytics db you built in HW5.

B. Develop queries that meet the following criteria.

- Show which semesters CS 345 was taught. Show semester title, course level, and course name. Order the query by semester.
- Show which semesters any course name containing "machine learning" was taught. Show semester title, course level, and course name. Order the query by semester.
- Show which semesters any course name containing "data struct" was taught. Show semester title, course level, and course name. Order the query by semester.

These queries will require the use of ```inner join```. Why do you need join?


### What to Turn In:
- You will be turning your sqlite db file, an sql file containing your create table statements, and an sql file containing your two queries.
