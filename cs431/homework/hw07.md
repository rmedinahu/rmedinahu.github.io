### MySQL Database: Activity Analytics I [Solution](#solution)

### Materials ==> [tracked_users_data.sql]({{ site.baseurl }}assets/cs431/tracked_users_data.sql)

### Description

The tracked users database contains two tables (user and tracker). The DDL for these two tables as well as sample data are included in the tracked_users_data.sql file linked above. The goal of this homework is to correctly write and execute the following queries against the sample database **using a MySQL** db management system.

To get started you will need to create a database in your mysql server. E.g., 

> mysql> create database track_users_db;

You will then need to "activate" the db, 

> mysql> use track_users_db;

You can "execute" the sql file as:

> mysql> source thesqlfilehere.sql

Now you're ready to go!

> NOTE: In mysql the sql syntax for joining two or more tables expects the ```join``` keyword.

> select * from table1 join table2 on ...

#### Query 1: Write a query that shows the number of logins per user per day. The query should show the last name and first initial of the user, followed by the day, followed by the number of logins (on that day). Order results by users last name in ascending order.

	/* Sample result at the end of the result. You should have the same number of rows.

	*/
	
#### Query 2: Write a query that shows the average number of daily logins. The result should be one row that shows the average and the total number of logins. **HINT: you will need to find the number of logins per day first. Then, take the average of those values.** Expected result:  

	/* Sample result. The column headers may be different but you should have the same result.
	+---------+-------+
	| average | total |
	+---------+-------+
	| 20.7425 | 15142 |
	+---------+-------+
	1 row in set (0.01 sec)
	*/

#### Query 3: Write a query that shows the average number of user logins for each month. For example, if 3 users logged in for a total of 21 times in December, 2016 then the average for that month would be 21/3 = 7 Note, you may need a nested query to aggregate users logins for each month then compute the average per month.  Order by month ascending. Show the average and the month. Example:

	/* Correct output should be listed as:
	+--------+----------------------+
	| month  | average_logins_month |
	+--------+----------------------+
